This article guides you through the different options you have to subscribe using a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin, Monero or Ethereum.

## How it works

At the moment cyrptocurrency subscriptions have to be processed manually. If you'd like to pay with Bitcoin, Monero or Ethereum then please send an email to [contact@anonaddy.com](mailto:contact@anonaddy.com) ([GPG Key](/anonaddy-contact-public-key.asc)) for further instructions.

I will be adding a way to automatically subscribe using cyrptocurrency in the near future.
