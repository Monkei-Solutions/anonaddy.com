## Setting up the server

Choosing a provider (that you trust), Vultr, Greenhost, OVH, Hetzner, Linode, Cockbox (make sure the host allows post 25 to be used, some providers block it).

With Vultr you may need to open a support ticket and request for them to unblock port 25.

Before starting you will want to check the IP of your new server to make sure it is not on any blacklists - [https://multirbl.valli.org/lookup/](https://multirbl.valli.org/lookup/)

If it is, destroy it and deploy a new one. You might notice that some providers such as Vultr have entire ranges of IPs listed.

You should have a fresh 20.04 Ubuntu server (or 18.04). I'm assuming that you have taken proper steps to secure the server (no root login, key auth only, 2FA, automatic security updates etc.).

Add Fail2ban, a Firewall (e.g UFW), make sure that ports 25, 22 (or whatever your SSH port is if you've changed it) 443 and 80 are open.

A good place to get started - [https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server](https://github.com/imthenachoman/How-To-Secure-A-Linux-Server)

[https://jacyhong.wordpress.com/2016/06/27/my-first-10-minutes-on-a-server-primer-for-securing-ubuntu/](https://jacyhong.wordpress.com/2016/06/27/my-first-10-minutes-on-a-server-primer-for-securing-ubuntu/)

[https://plusbryan.com/my-first-5-minutes-on-a-server-or-essential-security-for-linux-servers](https://plusbryan.com/my-first-5-minutes-on-a-server-or-essential-security-for-linux-servers)

I will be running all commands as a sudo user called `johndoe`. The domain used will be `example.com` and the hostname `mail.example.com`. I'll be using Vultr for this example (Note: if you also use Vultr for managing DNS records they do not currently support TSLA records required for DANE).

To check your server's hostname run:

```bash
hostname -f
```

If your hostname is not what it should be update it by running:

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname mail.example.com
```

Making sure to replace mail.example.com with your own domain.

## DNS records

Now let's add some basic DNS records.

We'll start with the MX record. This tells email sent to your domain where it should go.

```
MX @ mail.example.com
```

We want to direct it to our server's fully qualifed domain name (FQDN). Give it a priority of 10 (or just make sure it has the lowest priority if you have other MX records).

If you want to be able to also use wildcard subdomains e.g. (alias@username.example.com) then you also need to add a wildcard MX record:

```
MX * mail.example.com
```

This will tell email sent to any subdomain of example.com to go to the same place.

Add a wildcard A and AAAA (if using IPv6) record too if you want to use all subdomains (or just an A record for unsubscribe.example.com if not).

```
A * <Your-IPv4-address>
AAAA * <Your-IPv4-address>
```

If you want to just use the example.com domain and not bother with subdomains then you can skip the wildcard MX, A, AAAA records above (you will still need to add MX and A/AAAA for unsubscribe.example.com though to handle deactivating aliases).

Next we will add an explicit A record for the hostname `mail.example.com` and for where the web app will be located `app.example.com`

```
A mail.example.com <Your-IPv4-address>
A app.example.com <Your-IPv4-address>
```

If you are using IPv6 then you will also need to add an AAAA record

```
AAAA mail.example.com <Your-IPv6-address>
AAAA app.example.com <Your-IPv6-address>
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders above with the actual IP address of your server.

<div class="flex justify-center mb-4">
  <img class="shadow" src="/assets/img/dns-records.png" alt="DNS records" title="DNS records">
</div>

Now we need to set up the correct PTR record for reverse DNS lookups. This needs to be set as your FQDN (fully qualified domain name) which in our case is mail.example.com.

On your server run `host <Your-IPv4-address>` to check what it is.

You will likely need to login to your hosting provider to update your PTR record.

In Vultr you can update your reverse DNS by clicking on your server, then going to the settings tab, then IPv4 and click on the value in the "Reverse DNS" column.

Change it to `mail.example.com`. Don't forget to update this for IPv6 if you are using it too.

<div class="flex justify-center mb-4">
  <img class="shadow" src="/assets/img/reverse-dns-ipv4.png" alt="Reverse DNS IPv4" title="Reverse DNS IPv4">
</div>

You can check that it is set correctly by entering your IPv4 and IPv6 addresses here [https://mxtoolbox.com/ReverseLookup.aspx](https://mxtoolbox.com/ReverseLookup.aspx).

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <img class="shadow" src="/assets/img/reverse-dns-ipv6.png" alt="Reverse DNS IPv6" title="Reverse DNS IPv6">
</div>

## Installing Postfix

Now we're going to install our MTA (mail transfer agent) Postfix.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postfix
```
For configuration type select "Internet Site".

<div class="flex justify-center mb-4">
  <img class="shadow" src="/assets/img/postfix-install.png" alt="Postfix install" title="Postfix install">
</div>

For System mail name: enter "example.com" note the missing mail subdomain.

<div class="flex justify-center mb-4">
  <img class="shadow" src="/assets/img/postfix-install-2.png" alt="Postfix install system name" title="Postfix install system name">
</div>

Postfix should now begin installing.

If you would like to check the version of Postfix that you are running you can do:

```bash
sudo postconf mail_version
```

At the time of writing this I am running `mail_version = 3.4.13`.

We'll install an extension we will need later so that Postfix can query our database.

```bash
sudo apt install postfix-mysql
```

Now let's update our Postfix config file. A lot of the items in this file don't exist yet, but don't worry, we'll create them soon.

```bash
sudo vim /etc/postfix/main.cf
```

Or use nano if you like.

Replace the file contents with the following (replacing example.com with your own domain):

```
smtpd_banner = $myhostname ESMTP
biff = no

# appending .domain is the MUA's job.
append_dot_mydomain = no

readme_directory = no

# See http://www.postfix.org/COMPATIBILITY_README.html -- default to 2 on

```

<div class="flex justify-center mb-4">
  <img class="shadow" src="/assets/img/postfix-main.png" alt="Postfix main" title="Postfix main">
</div>

Make sure your hostname is correct in the Postfix config file.

```bash
sudo postconf myhostname
```

You'll see warnings that the mysql-... files do not exist. You should see mail.example.com if you don't edit `/etc/postfix/main.cf` and update the myhostname value.

Open up `/etc/postfix/master.cf` and update this line at the top of the file:

```
smtp       inet  n       -       -       -       -       smtpd
        -o content_filter=anonaddy:dummy
```

This should be the only line for smtp.

<div class="flex justify-center mb-4">
  <img class="shadow" src="/assets/img/postfix-master.png" alt="Postfix master" title="Postfix master">
</div>

Then add these lines to the bottom of the file:

```
anonaddy unix - n n - - pipe
  flags=F user=johndoe argv=php /var/www/anonaddy/artisan anonaddy:receive-email --sender=${sender} --recipient=${recipient} --local_part=${user} --extension=${extension} --domain=${domain} --size=${size}
```

Making sure to replace `johndoe` with the username of the user who will run the artisan command and also to update the /path to wherever you plan to place the web app installation. For this tutorial I'm going to use the location `/var/www/anonaddy`.

<div class="flex justify-center mb-4">
  <img class="shadow" src="/assets/img/postfix-master-2.png" alt="Postfix master pipe" title="Postfix master pipe">
</div>

This command will pipe the email through to our applicaton so that we can determine who the alias belongs to and who to forward the email to.

## Installing Nginx

On Ubuntu 20.04 Nginx is included in the default repositories so we can simply run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
sudo nginx -v
```

If you're on Ubuntu 18.04 you will need to add the following signing key and repo.

Import the nginx signing key and the repository.

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys 'https://nginx.org/keys/nginx_signing.key'
sudo sh -c "echo 'deb https://nginx.org/packages/mainline/ubuntu/ '$(lsb_release -cs)' nginx' > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/Nginx.list"
```

Then you can Install and check the version.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
sudo nginx -v
```

At the time of writing this I have `nginx version: nginx/1.18.0`.

Create the directory for where the application will be stored.

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/
```

First we'll generate a stronger DHE parameter for Nginx by running:

```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/ssl
sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem 4096
```

The above command will take quite some time, so go grab a cup of tea/coffee!

Next create the Nginx server block:

```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/nginx/conf.d/example.com.d
sudo nano /etc/nginx/conf.d/example.com.conf
```

Add the following inside

```
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        server_name app.example.com;
        return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}

server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;
    server_name app.example.com;
    root /var/www/anonaddy/public;
    server_tokens off;

    add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
    add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
    add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
    add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload";
    add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; img-src 'self' data:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; font-src 'self'; object-src 'none'";
    add_header Referrer-Policy "origin-when-cross-origin";
    add_header Expect-CT "enforce, max-age=604800";

    index index.html index.htm index.php;

    charset utf-8;

    ssl_certificate             /etc/nginx/conf.d/example.com.d/server.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key         /etc/nginx/conf.d/example.com.d/server.key;
    ssl_trusted_certificate     /root/.acme.sh/example.com/fullchain.cer;

    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers   on;
    ssl_session_timeout         5m;
    ssl_protocols               TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_stapling                on;
    ssl_stapling_verify         on;
    ssl_ciphers                 "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384";
    ssl_ecdh_curve              secp384r1;
    ssl_session_cache           shared:SSL:10m;
    ssl_session_tickets         off;
    ssl_dhparam                 /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
    }

    location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }
    location = /robots.txt  { access_log off; log_not_found off; }

    error_page 404 /index.php;

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $realpath_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }

    location ~ /\.(?!well-known).* {
        deny all;
    }
}
```

```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```
Change the user to johndoe.

We won't restart nginx yet because it won't be able to find the SSL certificates and will throw an error.

## Installing PHP

We're going to install the latest version of PHP at the time of writing this - version 7.4

If you are using Ubuntu 18.04 you will need to add the below repository, Ubuntu 20.04 can skip this step.

```bash
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
sudo apt update
```

Install PHP7.4 and check the version.

```bash
sudo apt install php7.4-fpm
php-fpm7.4 -v
```

Install some required extensions:

```bash
sudo apt install php7.4-common php7.4-mysql php7.4-dev php7.4-mbstring php7.4-gd php7.4-imagick php7.4-opcache php7.4-soap php7.4-zip php7.4-cli php7.4-curl php-mailparse php-gnupg php-redis -y
```

```bash
sudo nano /etc/php/7.4/fpm/pool.d/www.conf
```

```
user = johndoe
group = johndoe
listen.owner = johndoe
listen.group = johndoe
```

<div class="flex justify-center">
  <img class="shadow" src="/assets/img/php-www-conf.png" alt="PHP www.conf" title="PHP www.conf">
</div>

## Let's Encrypt

Now we need to get an SSL certificate using Acme.sh.

We again need to switch to the root user to run these commands:

```bash
sudo su
```

Download the install script from GitHub and run it.

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh.git
cd ./acme.sh
./acme.sh --install
```
<div class="flex justify-center mb-4">
  <img class="shadow" src="/assets/img/acme-install.png" alt="acme.sh install" title="acme.sh install">
</div>

You should set up automatic DNS API integration for wildcard certs if you are using them, this will allow automatic renewal of your certificates.

[https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh#8-automatic-dns-api-integration](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh#8-automatic-dns-api-integration)

For example, instructions for Vultr are here - [https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/dnsapi#82-use-vultr-dns-api-to-automatically-issue-cert](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/dnsapi#82-use-vultr-dns-api-to-automatically-issue-cert)

I would run:

```bash
export VULTR_API_KEY="<Your API key>"
```

To install the certificate run:

```bash
./acme.sh --issue -d example.com -d '*.example.com' --dns dns_vultr \
--keylength 4096 \
--key-file       /etc/nginx/conf.d/example.com.d/server.key  \
--fullchain-file /etc/nginx/conf.d/example.com.d/server.crt \
--reloadcmd     "service nginx force-reload"
```

Make sure to change example.com to your domain.

You can now type `exit` to go back to the `johndoe` user instead of `root`.

## SPF and DKIM

Follow the instructions in the linked blog post at the end of this section on how to install OpenDKIM and then add an SPF record.

The only differences are the following couple of points:

```
Canonicalization   simple
Mode               sv
SubDomains         yes
```

Also when editing `/etc/opendkim/signing.table` add this line too so that emails from subdomain aliases will also be signed.

```
*@*.example.com    default._domainkey.example.com
```

[https://www.linuxbabe.com/mail-server/setting-up-dkim-and-spf](https://www.linuxbabe.com/mail-server/setting-up-dkim-and-spf)

Once you've finished following the above post you should have SPF and DKIM set up for your domain.

## DMARC

Next follow this blog post on how to install OpenDMARC.

[https://www.linuxbabe.com/mail-server/opendmarc-postfix-ubuntu](https://www.linuxbabe.com/mail-server/opendmarc-postfix-ubuntu)

Next add a new TXT record to your domain for DMARC with a host of `@` and value:

```
v=DMARC1; p=none; pct=100; rua=mailto:dmarc-reports@example.com
```

For further reading about DMARC records and the different options available see - [https://www.linuxbabe.com/mail-server/create-dmarc-record](https://www.linuxbabe.com/mail-server/create-dmarc-record)

You should now have a valid DMARC record for your domain.

  <img class="shadow" src="/assets/img/dns-records-2.png" alt="DNS records DMARC" title="DNS records DMARC">
</div>

## Installing MariaDB

At the time of writing this the latest stable release is v10.5. Make sure to check for any newer releases.

Follow the instructions on this link to install MariaDB (make sure to change to 18.04 if you are using it):

[https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/repositories/#distro=Ubuntu&distro_release=focal--ubuntu_focal&mirror=digital-pacific&version=10.5](https://downloads.mariadb.org/mariadb/repositories/#distro=Ubuntu&distro_release=focal--ubuntu_focal&mirror=digital-pacific&version=10.5)

Make sure it is running correctly and check the version

```bash
sudo systemctl status mariadb
sudo mysql -V
```

At the time of writing this I am using "Ver 15.1 Distrib 10.5.6-MariaDB"

Set a secure MySQL root password by running the command below and make a note of it somewhere e.g. password manager.

Answer `no` for "Switch to unix_socket authentication" and `no` for "Change the root password?" as you have already set it in the first step. Answer `yes` (default) to the other questions.

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

Next we're going to create the database and also a user with correct permissions.

```bash
sudo mysql -u root -p
```
Once in the MariaDB shell create a new database called anonaddy_database (or whatever you like)

```sql
CREATE DATABASE anonaddy_database;
```

Then create a new user and give them a strong password (replace below)

```sql
CREATE USER 'anonaddy'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'STRONG-PASSWORD-HERE';
```

Grant the user privileges for the new database.

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON anonaddy_database.* TO 'anonaddy'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
```

Next flush privileges and exit the MariaDB shell.

```sql
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit
```

Create a new file `/etc/postfix/mysql-virtual-alias-domains-and-subdomains.cf` and enter the following inside:

```sql
user = anonaddy
password = your-database-password
hosts = 127.0.0.1
dbname = anonaddy_database
query = SELECT (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE '%s' IN (CONCAT(username, '.example.com'))) AS users, (SELECT 1 FROM additional_usernames WHERE '%s' IN (CONCAT(additional_usernames.username, '.example.com'))) AS usernames, (SELECT 1 FROM domains WHERE domains.domain = '%s' AND domains.domain_verified_at IS NOT NULL) AS domains LIMIT 1;
```

If you need to add multiple domains then just update the above query to:

```sql
query = SELECT (SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE '%s' IN (CONCAT(username, '.example.com'),CONCAT(username, '.example2.com'))) AS users, (SELECT 1 FROM additional_usernames WHERE '%s' IN (CONCAT(additional_usernames.username, '.example.com'),CONCAT(additional_usernames.username, '.example2.com'))) AS usernames, (SELECT 1 FROM domains WHERE domains.domain = '%s' AND domains.domain_verified_at IS NOT NULL) AS domains LIMIT 1;
```

This file is responsible for determining whether the server should accept email for a certain domain/subdomain. If no results are found from the query then the email will not be accepted.

The reason these SQL queries are not all nicely formatted is because they have to be on one line.

Next create another new file `/etc/postfix/mysql-recipient-access.cf` and enter the following inside:

```sql
user = anonaddy
password = your-database-password
hosts = 127.0.0.1
dbname = anonaddy_database
query = CALL check_access('%s')
```

This file is responsible for checking first whether an alias exists, and if so has it been deactivated or deleted. If it has been deactivated or deleted then return 'DISCARD' or 'REJECT'.

If the alias has not been deactivated or deleted or it does not exist then it also checks whether the alias is for a user, additional username or custom domain and if so, is that additional username or custom domain set as active. If it is not set as active then the email is discarded. It also checks if the user, additional usename or custom domain has catch-all enabled, and if not and the alias does not already exist then the email is rejected.

The reason we're using a stored procedure here is so that we can run multiple queries and use IF statements.

Either from the command line (`sudo mysql -u root -p`) or from an SQL client, run the following code to create the stored procedure.

If you have any issues creating the stored procedure, make sure you have set appropriate permissions for your database user.

```sql
DELIMITER $$

USE `anonaddy_database`$$

DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS `check_access`$$

CREATE DEFINER=`anonaddy`@`localhost` PROCEDURE `check_access`(alias_email VARCHAR(254) charset utf8)

 END$$

DELIMITER ;
```

If you need to add multiple domains then just update both of the IN sections to:

```sql
IN (CONCAT(username, '.example.com'),CONCAT(username, '.example2.com'))
```

You may be wondering why we have this line near the top of the procedure:

```sql
IF LOCATE('+',alias_email) = 0 THEN
```

This is present because Postfix will pass multiple arguments (substrings of the alias) to this stored procedure for each incoming email.

From the Postfix docs for [check_recipient_access](http://www.postfix.org/postconf.5.html#check_recipient_access):

> "Search the specified access(5) database for the resolved RCPT TO address, domain, parent domains, or localpart@, and execute the corresponding action."

What this means is that if an email comes in for the alias - hello+extension@username.example.com then Postfix will run the stored procedure with the following arguements and order:

```sql
CALL check_access('hello+extension@username.example.com');
CALL check_access('hello@username.example.com'); # We want it to stop the checks here which is why we return 'DUNNO'
CALL check_access('username.example.com');
CALL check_access('example.com');
CALL check_access('com');
CALL check_access('hello@');
```

We only want the queries to be run for the RCPT TO address (hello@username.example.com) without any + extension, which is what the check above does. It also prevents needless database queries being run by returning 'DUNNO' when it finds a match.

Update the permissions and the group of these files:

```bash
sudo chmod o= /etc/postfix/mysql-virtual-alias-domains-and-subdomains.cf /etc/postfix/mysql-recipient-access.cf

sudo chgrp postfix /etc/postfix/mysql-virtual-alias-domains-and-subdomains.cf /etc/postfix/mysql-recipient-access.cf
```

Make a test call for the stored procedure as your database user to ensure everything is working as expected.

```sql
USE anonaddy_database;
CALL check_access('email@example.com');
```

You will get an error stating "Table 'anonaddy_database.aliases' doesn't exist" as we have not yet migrated the database.

## Installing Redis

Follow this short post on Digital Ocean to install Redis.

[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-redis-on-ubuntu-20-04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-redis-on-ubuntu-20-04)

We'll be using Redis for queues, user limits, sessions and caching.

## The web application

Next let's get the actual AnonAddy application from GitHub.

```bash
cd /var/www/
git clone https://github.com/anonaddy/anonaddy.git
cd /var/www/anonaddy
```

Make sure composer is installed (`composer -V`), if not then goto - [https://getcomposer.org/download/](https://getcomposer.org/download/) for instructions.

You can add the following flags when running the composer-setup.php command to add it to your $PATH:

```bash
sudo php composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer
```

Before running the NVM install script below make sure that you have a `~/.bashrc` file. If not create one by running `touch ~/.bashrc` so that the NVM installer can be added to your $PATH. Also create a `~/.bash_profile` and add:

```bash
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
  . ~/.bashrc
fi
```

Make sure node is installed (`node -v`) if not then install it using NVM - [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04#option-3-%E2%80%94-installing-node-using-the-node-version-manager](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-20-04#option-3-%E2%80%94-installing-node-using-the-node-version-manager)

At the time of writing this I'm using the latest LTS - v12.19.0

```bash
cd /var/www/anonaddy
composer install --prefer-dist --no-dev -o && npm install
npm run production
```

Next copy the .env.example file and update it with correct values (database password, app url, redis password etc.)

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

Make sure to update the database settings, redis password and the AnonAddy variables. You can use Redis for queue, sessions and cache.

We'll set `ANONADDY_SIGNING_KEY_FINGERPRINT` shortly.

`APP_KEY` will be generted in the next step, this is used by Laravel for securely encrypting values.

For more information on Laravel configuration please visit - [https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/installation#configuration](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/installation#configuration)

For the `ANONADDY_DKIM_SIGNING_KEY` you only need to fill in this variable if you plan to add any custom domains through the web application.

You can either use the same private DKIM signing key we generated earlier from this tutorial - [https://www.linuxbabe.com/mail-server/setting-up-dkim-and-spf](https://www.linuxbabe.com/mail-server/setting-up-dkim-and-spf)

Or you can generate a new private/public keypair and give your user `johndoe` ownership of the private key.

If you want to use the same key we already generated then you will need to add `johndoe` to the `opendkim` group by running:

```
sudo usermod -a -G opendkim johndoe
```

Make sure to also run `sudo chmod g+r /etc/opendkim/keys/example.com/default.private` so that your johndoe user has read permissions for the file.

You'll need to log out and back in again for the changes to take effect.

You can test it by running `cat /etc/opendkim/keys/example.com/default.private` as the johndoe user to see if it can be displayed.

Doing this will cause opendkim to show a warning in your `mail.log` like this:

```
default._domainkey.example.com: key data is not secure: /etc/opendkim/keys/example.com/default.private is in group <group-number> which has multiple users
```

If you'd like to suppress this warning then you can add `RequireSafeKeys false` to your `/etc/opendkim.conf` file and restart opendkim - `sudo service opendkim restart`.

Then update your `.env` file.

```
ANONADDY_DKIM_SIGNING_KEY=/etc/opendkim/keys/example.com/default.private
```

Then we will generate an app key, migrate the database, link the storage directory, restart the queue and install laravel passport.

```bash
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan storage:link

php artisan config:cache
php artisan view:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan queue:restart

php artisan passport:install
```

## Installing Supervisor

We will be using supervisor for keeping the Laravel queue worker alive.

```bash
sudo apt install supervisor
```

Create a new configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/anonaddy.conf
```

Enter the following inside (change user, command location and the number of processes if you need to):

```
[program:anonaddy]
process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
command=php /var/www/anonaddy/artisan queue:work redis --sleep=3 --tries=3
autostart=true
autorestart=true
user=johndoe
numprocs=8
redirect_stderr=true
stopwaitsecs=3600
```

<div class="flex justify-center mb-4">
  <img class="shadow" src="/assets/img/supervisor.png" alt="Supervisor config" title="Supervisor config">
</div>

Then run:

```bash
sudo supervisorctl reread

sudo supervisorctl update

sudo supervisorctl start anonaddy:*
```

## Creating your account

You should now be able to visit `app.example.com` if you've set the correct DNS records.

Register an account and start using it straight away!

You can disable user registration after you've created your account to prevent anyone else from signing up.

Just update the value of `ANONADDY_ENABLE_REGISTRATION` to false in your .env file (and then run `php artisan config:cache` to update).

## Adding your private key to sign emails

If you are using encryption and want to sign your forwarded emails then you'll need to create a new GPG key pair.

A simple guide can be found here - [https://www.linuxbabe.com/security/a-practical-guide-to-gpg-part-1-generate-your-keypair](https://www.linuxbabe.com/security/a-practical-guide-to-gpg-part-1-generate-your-keypair)

You will need to generate a key pair without giving it a password because php-gnupg is not able to use keys that are password protected.

To find your key's fingerprint run:

```bash
gpg -k
```

The fingerprint is 40 characters long and looks like this `26A987650243B28802524E2F809FD0D502E2F695`.

Then update the value of `ANONADDY_SIGNING_KEY_FINGERPRINT=` in your .env file to match the fingerprint of your key.

Then run `php artisan config:cache` to update.

## What to do next

The above steps are enough to get you set up and running with AnonAddy but if you'd like to take it further then keep reading.

## Installing Spamassassin

We can use Spamassassin to reject spam emails arriving at our server.

```bash
sudo apt install spamassassin spamc

sudo systemctl enable spamassassin

sudo systemctl start spamassassin
```

Next install the milter so that we can reject emails if they have a high spam score.

```bash
sudo apt install spamass-milter
```

Update `/etc/postfix/main.cf` and add the milter to smtpd_milters.

```
# Milter configuration
milter_default_action = accept
milter_protocol = 6
smtpd_milters = local:opendkim/opendkim.sock,local:opendmarc/opendmarc.sock,local:spamass/spamass.sock
non_smtpd_milters = $smtpd_milters
```

You can change the score needed in order for an email to be rejected by editing `/etc/default/spamass-milter`.

```
# Reject emails with spamassassin scores > 15.
#OPTIONS="${OPTIONS} -r 15"
```

Just uncomment the OPTIONS line and change 15 to something else, for example 7.5

```
# Reject emails with spamassassin scores > 7.5.
OPTIONS="${OPTIONS} -r 7.5"
```

Next restart Spamassassin and Postfix

```bash
sudo systemctl restart postfix spamass-milter
```

If you want to test if Spamassasin is working then send an email with the content from this link in it.

[https://spamassassin.apache.org/gtube/](https://spamassassin.apache.org/gtube/)

It should be rejected with the message `ERROR_CODE :550, ERROR_CODE :5.7.1 Blocked by SpamAssassin`.

## Setting up a local caching DNS resolver

This is to speed up queries and to prevent you getting rate limited when querying DNSBLs (DNS black lists) etc.

Follow the below blog post on how to install bind9.

[https://www.linuxbabe.com/ubuntu/set-up-local-dns-resolver-ubuntu-20-04-bind9](https://www.linuxbabe.com/ubuntu/set-up-local-dns-resolver-ubuntu-20-04-bind9)

Or if you're using Ubuntu 18.04 then:

[https://www.linuxbabe.com/ubuntu/set-up-local-dns-resolver-ubuntu-18-04-16-04-bind9](https://www.linuxbabe.com/ubuntu/set-up-local-dns-resolver-ubuntu-18-04-16-04-bind9)

Now open up `/etc/nginx/conf.d/example.com.conf` and add these two lines below the ssl parameters.

```
resolver                    127.0.0.1 valid=86400s;
resolver_timeout            5s;
```

<div class="flex justify-center mb-4">
  <img class="shadow" src="/assets/img/nginx-resolver.png" alt="Nginx resolver" title="Nginx resolver">
</div>

Restart nginx:

```bash
sudo service nginx restart
```

Restart the server by running `sudo reboot` and then SSH back in.

Next to test if everything is working run:

```bash
host -tTXT 2.0.0.127.multi.uribl.com
```

You should see the response

```bash
2.0.0.127.multi.uribl.com descriptive text "permanent testpoint"
```

This means you can query URIBL successfully now.

Update `/etc/spamassassin/local.cf` and add this near the top:

```
dns_available yes
```

Then restart spamassassin.

```bash
sudo service spamassassin restart
```

## Updating

Before updating, please check the release notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/anonaddy/anonaddy/releases) for any breaking changes.

In order to update you can run the following commands:

```bash
git pull origin master

composer install --prefer-dist --no-dev -o
npm update
npm run production
php artisan migrate

php artisan config:cache
php artisan view:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan queue:restart
```

This should pull in any updates from the GitHub repository and update your dependencies. It will then run any migrations before finally clearing the cache and restarting the queue workers.
